Uploading required package:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
MData <- read.csv("measurements.csv")
```

Inspecting the dataframe:
```{r}
tail(MData)
```
```{r}
head(MData)
```
```{r}
summary(MData)
```
```{r}
str(MData)
```
```{r}
dim(MData)
```

Using regular expressions and dplyr to change genus name:
NOTE: In assignment 1, my column was titled "species" rather than "Organism," so that's what we're working with here
```{r}
MData <- MData %>%
  mutate(Sp = gsub("(\\w)\\w+(.*)","\\1\\.\\2", measurements$species)) %>% #regular expression to change genus name to first letter
  select(Sp, everything()) %>% #Moving Sp column to beginning of dataframe
  select(-c(species)) #Dropping the species column 
head(MData)
```
```{r}
tail(MData)
```

```{r}
write.csv(MData, "MeasShort.csv", row.names=FALSE)
```
